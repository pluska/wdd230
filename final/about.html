          <h2>Foundation and Early Years (1990-2000)</h2>
          <p>Danny Shoes was founded in 1990 by Daniel Martinez, a passionate shoemaker with a vision to create footwear that blends comfort with style. Starting in a small workshop in the heart of a bustling city, Danny began crafting shoes that quickly gained a reputation for their quality and comfort. Focused initially on classic designs, the brand soon became a local favorite.</p>
